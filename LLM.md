### Summary

In this chapter, we explored how to build a conversational application using LangChain, progressively adding more sophisticated capabilities. Starting from a simple vanilla chatbot, we integrated memory to track interactions and embedded non-parametric knowledge into the system. We enhanced the chatbot's functionality by making it agentic, allowing it to use its parametric knowledge and tools dynamically. We extended its capabilities further by adding external tools such as Google SerpApi for live search results. Finally, we wrapped the entire application with a user-friendly front-end using Streamlit, illustrating a practical method to develop a fully functional conversational bot that can plan itineraries or provide up-to-date travel information.

    md['genres'] = md['genres'].apply(ast.literal_eval).apply(lambda x: [genre['name'] for genre in x])
    ```
2. **Calculate Weighted Ratings**:
    ```python
    def calculate_weighted_rate(vote_average, vote_count, min_vote_count=10):
        return (vote_count / (vote_count + min_vote_count)) * vote_average + (min_vote_count / (vote_count + min_vote_count)) * 5.0
    md['weighted_rate'] = md.apply(lambda row: calculate_weighted_rate(row['vote_average'], row['vote_count'], min_vote_count), axis=1)
    ```
3. **Combine Info for LLM**:
    ```python
    md_final['combined_info'] = md_final.apply(lambda row: f"Title: {row['title']}. Overview: {row['overview']} Genres: {', '.join(row['genres'])}. Rating: {row['weighted_rate']}", axis=1).astype(str)
    ```

#### LLM-Powered Retrieval 
1. **Initialize Retriever**:
    ```python
    from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import LanceDB
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    docsearch = LanceDB(connection=table, embedding=embeddings)
    ```
2. **Set Up Chain**:
    ```python
    qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)
    query = "I'm looking for an animated action movie. What could you suggest to me?"
    result = qa({"query": query})
    result['result']
    ```

#### Develop Front-end with Streamlit
1. **Configure Page**:
    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    st.set_page_config(page_title="MovieHarbor", page_icon="")
    st.header(' Welcome to MovieHarbor, your favourite movie recommender')
    ```
2. **Widgets for User Input**:
    ```python
    st.sidebar.title("Movie Recommendation System")
    st.sidebar.markdown("Please enter your details and preferences below:")
    age = st.sidebar.slider("What is your age?", 1, 100, 25)
    gender = st.sidebar.radio("What is your gender?", ("Male", "Female", "Other"))
