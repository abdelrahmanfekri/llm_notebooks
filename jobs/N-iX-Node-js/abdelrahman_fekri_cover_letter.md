Hiring Manager  
N-iX  
Poland  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Node.js/Angular Software Engineer position at N-iX, as advertised. With a strong background in software development, particularly in Node.js and Angular, coupled with my passion for creating innovative solutions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to N-iX's mission of leveraging advanced technologies to deliver high-quality software solutions in the glass packaging industry.

I am particularly drawn to N-iX due to its supportive and collaborative company culture, which aligns with my values of teamwork and continuous learning. The positive employee ratings and focus on professional development highlight a work environment where I can thrive and grow. Additionally, N-iX's commitment to sustainability and quality resonates with my personal and professional ethos.

In my previous roles, I have accumulated over three years of experience as a Software Engineer, working with technologies such as Node.js, TypeScript, and Angular. At Bld ai, I developed high-quality software solutions that required strong analytical and creative problem-solving skills. I successfully utilized tools like Docker and Git for version control and deployment, ensuring efficient and scalable applications. My experience in developing backend functionalities and managing APIs will enable me to effectively contribute to the local software application for communication with drivers in the glass manufacturing process.

One of my notable projects involved the development of a video conference application, O-Connect, where I was responsible for building the backend using Scala and Java. This experience honed my ability to handle high traffic and design robust systems, which I believe will be beneficial for the challenges at N-iX.

I am confident that my technical expertise, combined with my excellent communication skills, will make me an asset to your team. I thrive in environments that foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, and I am eager to contribute to N-iX's active tech communities and professional development initiatives. My entrepreneurial spirit, demonstrated through my co-founding of health-focused platforms, showcases my commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit, aligning well with N-iX's mission.

In summary, I am excited about the prospect of joining N-iX and contributing to impactful projects that align with my skills and values. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and passion for software development can contribute to the success of N-iX.

Thank you for considering my application. I hope to discuss my candidacy further.

Sincerely,
