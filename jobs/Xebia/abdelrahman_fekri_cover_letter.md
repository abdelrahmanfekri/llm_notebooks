**Hiring Manager**  
Xebia  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Fullstack Developer position at Xebia, as advertised. With over six years of experience in software development, particularly in creating scalable web solutions using React and Node.js, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Xebia's mission of being recognized as a leading authority in cloud-based solutions and technology.

Xebia’s commitment to innovation, knowledge sharing, and personal development resonates deeply with my professional philosophy. I am particularly drawn to your culture of continuous learning, which is evident in your support for technology conferences and internal training programs. As someone who has always prioritized self-improvement and staying updated with the latest technologies, I believe that Xebia provides the ideal environment for me to grow both personally and professionally.

In my previous roles, I have successfully developed a range of applications, including a scalable video conferencing platform, O-Connect, utilizing React, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. My experience aligns well with the requirements outlined in the job description, including:

- **Frontend Development:** I have over three years of experience with React, coupled with strong knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript. My projects have involved creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces that enhance user experience.

- **Backend Development:** My expertise in Node.js complements my frontend skills, allowing me to design and implement robust architectures. I have also managed global and client-side state and authentication standards, including JWT and OAuth.

- **Architectural Decisions:** I have actively participated in discussions regarding architectural decisions and have a solid understanding of web application architecture and design patterns, which I believe is crucial for the Senior Fullstack Developer role.

- **Testing and Quality Assurance:** My experience includes writing unit and component tests to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

My ability to communicate effectively with business representatives has enabled me to deliver relevant business value throughout my projects. I am fluent in English and have a strong track record of working collaboratively within diverse teams, which I understand is essential for engaging with Xebia’s global clientele.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on large projects requiring well-designed architectures and processes, as mentioned in the job description. I believe my background in AI and my passion for developing scalable solutions can contribute significantly to Xebia’s innovative projects.

One project that I am especially proud of is the development of Facewatch, a health monitoring application using facial expressions. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also aligned with my passion for creating impactful solutions that address real-world problems. It reflects my ability to think creatively and implement technology in ways that can genuinely benefit users, aligning perfectly with Xebia's mission.

I am eager to bring my expertise in full-stack development to Xebia and contribute to your team of over 140 frontend developers. I am confident that my technical skills, combined with my passion for continuous learning and innovation, make me an ideal candidate for this position. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the exciting projects at Xebia.

Sincerely,  
Abdelrahman Fekri
